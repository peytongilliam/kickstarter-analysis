It is recommended that Louise aim to have a lower budget in order to have a successful campaign. Findings show that her budget is above those of the successful campaigns in the dataset that was analyzed. 
# Analysis of Theater Kickstarters 

## Overview of Project
 This analysis was performed to find the outcomes of the theater kickstarters in order to determine the possiblity of a successful kickstarter based on launch dates and goals.

### Purpose
 The purpose of this analysis was to figure out if our kickstarter would be successful or if we needed to make changes.

## Analysis and Challenges
 Below are images of the analyses performed and to the code that calculated or populated the information needed to determine the success and/or results of the kickstarters.

 One of the challenges that I encountered was when trying to find the number of successful, failed, or canceled kickstarters based on goal, I would occasionally make an error with one of my formulas which would in turn bring up the incorrect results when calculating the outcomes. I overcame these difficulties by reviewing my formulas to see if there were any errors and discovered my mistakes. I corrected my mistakes and was able to get the correct data for my analysis.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
 One of the conclusions that I came to when reviewing the outcomes of the theater kickstarters based on launch date was that they were most successful when in the months of May and June. 
 A second conclusion that I came to based on the outcomes due to the launch date was that they were least successful in the month of December.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
 I can conclude from the outcomes based on goals that most kickstarters that had a goal between 1000 and 4999 were the most successful with under 1000 being second. This is most likely due to having a decent goal while still having a high enough budget to produce an adequate play.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
 Some limitations of this dataset are not knowing if some of these theater kickstarters included the cost of possibly building a theater, creating sets, buying costumes, paying for lighting or simply just hiring actors. These details might help when trying to determine what the goals for the productions were going toward which in turn would help determine what kind of budget is needed specifically for the play we were wanting to create.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
 Another possible graph we could create to show data could be a bar graph to show the numbers of successful, failed and canceled plays based on the goals they had. We could also possibly create a bar graph for the theater outcomes by launch date as well.
